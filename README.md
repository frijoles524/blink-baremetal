# blink-baremetal
0 dependency ATMEGA-328 led blink script. Some things to keep in mind: this is a very simple script with only the bare mininum for the specific pin to light up (pin 13 if I remember correctly). This probably isn't the best or most efficient way of doing this but I find the code easy to read. This project has been tested in an electronics simulation and seems to work fine
